# HashFi â€“ Decentralized On-Chain Reputation Protocol
**Track:** Onchain Finance & Real-World Assets
  
HashFi is a decentralized **on-chain reputation protocol** built on Hedera Hashgraph. It introduces the **Yield Passport**, a smart reputation score that helps users and protocols build trust in DeFi by combining behavioral, financial, and risk-based metrics.

# Hedera Integration Summary
ðŸ”µ**Hedera Smart Contracts (HSCS)**

We deployed the core logic of HashFi as a **Solidity smart contract** on **Hedera Smart Contract Service (HSCS).**
This enables **transparent**, **immutable**, and **verifiable** reputation scoring directly on-chain.

We chose HSCS because it provides:

â€¢ **Predictable low fees** (~$0.001 per transaction) ensuring scalability and sustainability.

â€¢ **High throughput** and **finality within seconds**, which is essential for updating user scores in real-time.

â€¢ **EVM compatibility**, allowing us to reuse familiar Solidity tools and libraries.

ðŸ”µ**Transaction Types Executed:**

  â€¢ ***ContractCreateTransaction*** :Deploy the main HashFi smart contract.

  â€¢ ***ContractExecuteTransaction*** :Update or calculate user reputation scores.

  â€¢ ***ContractCallQuery*** :Retrieve and display scores in the frontend dashboard.


 ðŸ”µ**Hedera Mirror Nodes**
 
The HashFi frontend and backend use **Mirror Node APIs** to fetch **verified on-chain data** for display and analytics.
We chose Mirror Nodes because they offer:


# Economic Justification

Hederaâ€™s **low, predictable transaction fees** and **high throughput** make it ideal for large-scale adoption in Africa and other emerging markets.

Each update or query of a userâ€™s reputation score costs **less than $0.001**, ensuring that the system remains affordable and scalable.

This **cost efficiency**, combined with **ABFT security and finality**, allows HashFi to maintain financial sustainability while delivering reliable on-chain data for millions of potential users.
