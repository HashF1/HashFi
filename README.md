# HashFi â€“ Decentralized On-Chain Reputation Protocol
**Track:** Onchain Finance & Real-World Assets
  
HashFi is a decentralized **on-chain reputation protocol** built on Hedera Hashgraph. It introduces the **Yield Passport**, a smart reputation score that helps users and protocols build trust in DeFi by combining behavioral, financial, and risk-based metrics.

# Hedera Integration Summary
**1- Hedera Smart Contracts (HSCS)**

We deployed the core logic of HashFi as a **Solidity smart contract** on **Hedera Smart Contract Service (HSCS).**
This enables **transparent**, **immutable**, and **verifiable** reputation scoring directly on-chain.

We chose HSCS because it provides:

â€¢ **Predictable low fees** (~$0.001 per transaction) ensuring scalability and sustainability.

â€¢ **High throughput** and **finality within seconds**, which is essential for updating user scores in real-time.

â€¢ **EVM compatibility**, allowing us to reuse familiar Solidity tools and libraries.

**Transaction Types Executed:**

  â€¢ ContractCreateTransaction :Deploy the main HashFi smart contract.

  â€¢ ContractExecuteTransaction :Update or calculate user reputation scores.

  â€¢ ContractCallQuery :Retrieve and display scores in the frontend dashboard.


 **2- Hedera Mirror Nodes**
 
The HashFi frontend and backend use **Mirror Node APIs** to fetch **verified on-chain data** for display and analytics.
We chose Mirror Nodes because they offer:
# Features
ðŸ”¹**On-chain reputation score** : Evaluates user wallets based on activity, consistency, and risk.

ðŸ”¹**Yield Passport for wallets & protocols** : A DeFi trust identity that can be used across protocols.

ðŸ”¹**Transparent scoring (0â€“1000)** : Combines behavioral, financial, and risk data.

ðŸ”¹**Built on Hedera** : Fast, secure, and low-fee blockchain network.

ðŸ”¹**Interoperable Design** : The system architecture can be extended to other blockchains.


# Tech Stack
HashFi combines **Web3**, **DeFi analytics**, and **Hedera Hashgraph** technologies.

â–¹**Hedera Hashgraph** : High-speed, low-fee DLT used for score recording and validation.

â–¹**Smart Contracts** : Core logic for the Yield Passport and reputation scoring. 

â–¹**React.js** : Fast UI layer for interaction with on-chain data.

â–¹**HashConnect + Ethers.js** : Wallet connection and smart contract communication.

â–¹**Recharts / Chart.js** : Data representation of wallet and score analytics.
